# Overview

I've been wanting to make a work on some projects in python, and what a better way to start then creating a game!

# Development Environment

This project was built using PyCharm and python. I also used the arcade and pygame libraries. 

# Useful Websites

Python is very new for me, so I used the following websites to help me get the basics:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-playing-audio-file-in-pygame/?ref=rp
https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/
https://www.w3schools.com/python/

# Future Work

- Speed up the game - not redrawing every time that the user clicks a button
- Not allow user to pass through barriers
